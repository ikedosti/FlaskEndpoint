1. Importing Libraries:

    The necessary libraries, such as Flask, TensorFlow, NumPy, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and BytesIO, are imported.
    
    
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO


2. Initializing Flask App:

    An instance of the Flask web application is created.
    
app = Flask(__name__)


3. Loading TensorFlow Model:

    The TensorFlow saved model is loaded using tf.saved_model.load('1').
    
mod = tf.saved_model.load('1')

4. Defining Class Names and Image Shape:

    The class names for the output categories and the image shape are defined.
    
class_names = ["cardboard", "glass", "metal", "paper", "plastic", "trash"]
im_shape = (256, 256) --> image shape (resize original image to the size that the model needs


5. Image Preprocessing Function:

    The preprocess_image function takes an image buffer as input, reads it using PIL, resizes it to the specified image shape, converts it to a NumPy array, expands dimensions, and applies preprocessing specific to the ResNet50 model.
    

def preprocess_image(img_buffer):

    img = Image.open(BytesIO(img_buffer))
    img = img.resize((im_shape[0], im_shape[1]))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    img_array = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(img_array)
    return img_array
    
6. Image Prediction Function:

    The predict_image function takes the preprocessed image array, passes it through the loaded model, applies softmax to get probabilities, and returns the predicted class and confidence score.


def predict_image(img_array):

    predictions = mod(img_array)
    score = tf.nn.softmax(predictions[0])
    return class_names[np.argmax(score)], 100 * np.max(score)

7. Flask Route for Prediction:

    The /predict route is defined to handle POST requests with image data. It reads the image buffer from the request, preprocesses it, and makes predictions using the defined functions.


@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():

    try:
        # Read image data from the request
        img_buffer = request.files['image'].read()
        print(f"Received request for an image of buffer length {len(img_buffer)}")

        # Preprocess the image
        img_array = preprocess_image(img_buffer)

        # Make predictions
        prediction, confidence = predict_image(img_array)

        # Prepare and return the result as JSON
        result = {
            'class': prediction,
            'confidence': confidence
        }

        return jsonify(result)

    except Exception as e:
        # Handle exceptions and return an error message
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)})
        


8. Error Handling:

    Exception handling is implemented to catch and return any errors that might occur during the prediction process.
    
except Exception as e:
    return jsonify({'error': str(e)})

9. Flask App Execution:

    The Flask app is run with the host set to "0.0.0.0" and port set to 80.
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=80)

10. Running the Application:
        When the script is executed, the Flask app runs, and the server starts listening for incoming requests on the specified host and port.

The primary purpose of this code is to provide a simple RESTful API for making predictions on images using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The model predicts the class (e.g., cardboard, glass) and provides a confidence score for the prediction.
